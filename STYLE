CODING STYLE GUIDELINES
-----------------------

These are the coding guidelines for the Google Instant Intergration Add-on.  If
the rules make no sense to you try to look at the code and figure it out.



Coding Style
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is what you write, not how you write it.

Basicly follow the Torvalds guidelines with a grain of salt.

General Style
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux kernel style with the following modifications.
	• Use camel-case variable and function names.  (JavaScript standard)
	• If statements have space around the brackets unless it is only comparing
		the return value.


Indentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All lines should be indented with a tab character (ASCII character 9).  Any
other spacing should be done with spaces.  The size of you editors tab doesn't
matter, anytime it sould need to, you should be using spaces.

Example:

function foo ( arg1, argTheSecond )
{
	int hello = 3;

	while ( hello = 5; hello < 304; hello++ ) {
		functionWithLotsOfArgs(
		                         "this is a string",
		                         5,
		                         false,
		                         "the last arg"
/* Little illistration of tabs and spaces
\t
	\t
		ssssssssssssssssssssssss
*/
		                      );
	}
}

You should notice that functionWithLotsOfArgs() is indented with 2 tabs.
Therfore, it's arguments are indented with 2 tabs, then the length of the
funtion name then 2 spaces for the variable names.  In this case there are no
arguments on the first line, this doesn't really matter to me.  If you want you
can put stuff there.  I usually only put stuff there if it is something like a
initilizer or structure the fuction needs and then put the other arguments
afterwords on other lines.  This is reminisant from C which I love so much.
